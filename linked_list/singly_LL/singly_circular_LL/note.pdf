advantages:
>> we can traverse the whole list from any node
>> implementationof algorithms like 'round robin' // in operating system
>> we can insert at the beginning and end by maintaining just one tail reference/pointer

disadvantages:
>> implementations of operations become complex since we need to make it circular everytime to maintain it
